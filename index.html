     <p class="lead siteText">Hello! And welcome to my website! My name is Alex and I am a <strong>Junior Web Developer</strong>. After a lifetime of Law Books, Corporate Meetings, Tehnical Support and Sales I took a chance and built up the courage to quit my job and pursue a career in Web Development. Building websites is something that has always peaked my interest, but I felt that I could never do it myself because one would need creativity, vision and a lifetime of work to gather the necessary skills. As I grew as a person I realised that the boundaries we have are most of the time put there by us, and with that mindset I set out to be the guy who made memorable user interfaces and websites. Now I am very glad I made that decision because, this is how I have found <strong>my passion and discovered my equal love for development and design and</strong> it's something that makes me wake up and go to work with excitement! I am one of the lucky few that discovers his passions in life and gets to do it as a job and I realised that this is what I want my career to be for the rest of my life. I love discovering and using new technologies, finding out what the latest trend is and figuring it out how I can implement certain design techniques into my own work. I am looking to create great projects with new UI/UX designs that make web sites a joy to browse through.</p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/margeanu.alexadrian/" target="_blank" id="popEffect"><i class="fab fa-facebook fa-2x" id="popEffect"></i></a><a href="https://github.com/AlexMargeanu" target="_blank" class="styling" id="popEffect"><i class="fab fa-github fa-2x github" id="popEffect"  ></i></a><button onclick="topFunction()" id="myBtn" class="myBtn" title="Go to top"><p>&#9650;</p></button>

  <p class="lead siteText">To start my journey I enlisted in a Web Development Course held by <strong>Codeberry</strong>. The reason why I chose them is because they did not go down the generic "Hello World" route which so many people copy these days, but opted to make a <strong>fully interactive course where you learn by doing</strong>. After I graduated and knew the basics, I had a diploma but didn't feel much different than before when it comes to actually building a website since I only had a basic understanding of how things work. Instead of signing up for yet another "learn to code in 3 months" course I just started <strong>building websites from scratch</strong>. I spoke to friends, acquaintances and many others to try and land some projects. The beginning was extremly difficult but I quickly got the hang of it simply because everywhere I looked for design and design implementation I was inspired and developed a whole lot more respect for people who create things out of nothing. I started simply with HTML5 and CSS3, learning positioning, the limits of the mark-up language and the building blocks of a good website. After that I learned some CSS animations keyframes, different effects and of course responsive design which inevitably brought me to Bootstrap. After a couple of difficult Bootstrap projects that made sure I understood the ins and outs of the framework, I started adding new features with JQuery, Sass and of course, Javascript. Now, I am looking for a full time development job where I can apply what I know, learn new techniques and get my skills tested every day so that I can grow as a developer. As far as soft skills go, I have been a <strong>project manager and a teacher</strong> in the past which gives me the ability to ultimately teach others what I now know, and (in my opinion) the most important development soft skill of all: <strong>I did it all by self teaching</strong>. In an industry where everything changes so fast and new languages and designs appear and dissapear at such a fast rate I believe it's important to be able to adapt to the new status quo.</p>
